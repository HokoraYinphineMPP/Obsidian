## Hey! I'm **James Wibowo**
### but some people call me **Hokora**.

I'm personally into doing many things, usually computer or media related! 

Stuff like... `Metro Minimalistic Motion Graphics, Drone Pilot, Aviation ATC, Classical and Jazz Piano, Midi Notating, Character Focused Illustrations, RNN/CNN Machine Learning Parsing, Aeronautic Engineering, Tracker Based DAWs, Character Modeling and Weight Rigging, Videography, Character Prefab Parsing in Unity, Front End Web Designing (Possibly fullstack in the future!), Concept Motion Illustrations, Rhythm Games, OBS Stream Formatting, Etc...`


I spend most of my time on Discord [![Add me on Discord!](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/803186540359450664/1020532660008910919/discord.png)](https://discord.com/users/221417731776446467 "Add me on Discord!") so the best way to contact me is through there!
